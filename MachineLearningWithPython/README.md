    - k-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier
    - Linear Classifier
    - Support Vector Classification
    - Linear Regression
    - Reinforcement Learning
    - Unsupervised Learning
    - Neural Networks
    - Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - PyTorch classifier
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Text Categorization
    - Information Retrieval
    - Information Extraction

## Course Structure
- The course puts you on an exciting journey with **Machine Learning (ML) using Python**.
    - It will start you off with simple ML concepts to understand and build on top of that
    - Taking you from simple classifier problems towards Deep Neural Networks and complex information extractions
- The course is structured in **15 sessions**, where each session is composed of the following elements
    - **Lesson** introducing new concepts and building on concepts from previous **Lessons**
    - **Project** to try out the new concepts
    - **YouTube** video explaining and demonstrating the concepts
        - A walkthrough of concepts in **Lesson** with demonstrating coding examples
        - An introduction of the **Project**
        - A **solution** of the project
    
## Are You Good Enough?
Worried about whether you have what it takes to complete this course?
- Do you have the necessary programming skills?
- Mathematics and statistics?
- Are you smart enough?

### What level of Python is needed?
- Some basic knowledge of Python and/or programming is highly recommended.
    - If you feel lost check out [this **free** Python for beginners course](https://www.learnpythonwithrune.org/learn-python/)
        - It is structured in 17 lessons
        - 8 hours of video tutorials
        - 17 projects taking you from scratch
        - It includes a [**free** eBook with all concepts](https://www.learnpythonwithrune.org/learn-python/)
        - It has a [GitHub repository with all examples and projects prepared for you](https://github.com/LearnPythonWithRune/LearnPython)
- There will be links to help materials when using difficult programming concepts.

### What about mathematics and statistics?
- Fortunately, when it comes to the complex math and statistics behind the Machine Learning models, you do not need to understand that part.
- All you need is to know how they work and can be used.
    - It's like driving a car. You do not have to be a car mechanic to drive it - yes, it helps you understand the basic knowledge of an engine and what the engine does.
    - Using Machine Learning models is like driving a car - you can get from A to B without being a car mechanic.
    
### Still worried?
- A lot of people consider me a smart guy - well, the truth is, I'm not
    - I just spend the hours learning it - I have no special talent
- In the end, it all depends on whether you are willing to spend the hours
- Yes, you can focus your efforts and succeed faster
    - How?
    - Well, structure it with focus and work on it consistently.
    - Structure your learning - many people try to do it all at once and fail - stay focused on one thing and learn well. 
    - Yes, structure is the key to your success.
